    <p class="P_class">
	The common work place environment is drastically changing. From technology to social interactions which are often not that social anymore; new skills are needed to adapt to be successful in the workplace. Simply being a hard worker is sometimes not enough to succeed in today’s workforce. Many of the skills needed are social skills such as professional communication, asking for help, and time management. These skills must be developed over the entirety of a professional career.
	Communication in a work place is critical due to misinterpretation leading to severe problems. Written communication must be precise but simple. Every employee and customer needs to understand what is being communicated and how it is being communicated. An employer must be detailed, clear, and concise when communicating with their employees so that everyone understands what is being conveyed. When communicating with a potential client especially with technology, the communication must be in a positive tone. Misinterpretation with a potential client could mean the loss of business and probable future business.
	Another important skill to learn in the work place is to simply ask for help. A lack of understanding how to complete a tasks can create time management problems for the rest of a work group. When working on a project with a team not knowing how to complete a task because you did not ask for help can change the group dynamic. Fellow team members will have to adjust to the problem later in the project instead of assisting when they had the time at the beginning of the project. Asking for help is often seen as a sign of weakness when it is in fact the opposite, knowing your strengths and weaknesses allow you to develop in the workplace. Learning this skill will always allow you to succeed and strive to be the best you can be in the work place.
	Time management is the most important skill learned in the workplace. Everything has a deadline from days even to years from now &amp; time management can help you succeed. Everyone has multiple facets of life that they have to balance such as family, work, and school. Time management allows us to give attention to all of these. Completing projects for work ahead of time allows us to review our work and create new ideas before the deadline. Allotting time in the work place by creating personal deadlines will make anyone a better employee because they will have work done before others and will be viewed as a faster worker.
	The workplace is constantly changing and therefore so must our skills. Communication is a key skill in the workplace. It is how we develop relationships with our co-workers and increase business. Asking for help is a skill that is critical in a group environment. A lack of knowledge on how to complete a task can create issues for the rest of the project team. To help with task issues we utilize time management by creating our own deadlines to get the tasks completed so we have time to address issues. All three of these skills are simple but powerful tools needed to excel in today’s work palce.
