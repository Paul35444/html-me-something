        When I first had my son I knew that I wanted him to have a dog of his own that he could grow up with. I could not do that until we moved out of our apartment. Soon after moving out I asked my then three year old son if he wanted to get a pet. A dog was the first choice on his list. After doing research for weeks we found what kind of dog we wanted. A husky was in our future and what a future it would be.

        After getting our husky my son &amp; I spent about a week trying to come up with a name for him and we decided on the name "Echo". I took two weeks off of work to train our new dog and potty train him. I had learned that huskies are difficult to train because they are so stubborn but it has been a reward to train him. He is a very well trained dog but I have to go over commands daily for only around fifteen minutes. Any longer than fifteen minutes and the training becomes play time to Echo which is not productive. Even with daily training Echo needs to expend a lot of energy which means a walk every night sometimes upwards of three miles. Huskies by nature are working dogs which most people see them pulling sleds in the snow so walks were a chore in the beginning because all Echo wanted to do was pull. The best way we found to train Echo to not pull was to take walks very slow to the point where when he did start to pull we would stop on our walk and make him sit and wait for a few seconds. Even with all of the constant training Echo has been a blessing in our lives. He keeps me company when my son is at school and he is a great playmate for my son.

        An addition of a husky into our family has been the best decision my son &amp; I have made since we moved into our new house. My son will have a dog to grow up with as well as an abundance of fluff that ends up on the ground daily. Huskies are pack animals like most dogs are but huskies get very attached to one person in particular. I have had dogs in the past but I had siblings and they bonded with the family dog more than I did. This is the first time that I get to spend all the time with my dog. Having a bond with my dog has been a great support system for me. As a father I cannot put my issues on my son but my dog is my support system. Most importantly I can talk to him about coding issues and by just talking to Echo and explaining the problem out loud I can solve the problem most of the time.
